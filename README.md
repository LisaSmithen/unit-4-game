Crystal Collector: WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE PLANET

GAME RULES:
The robots have attacked and stolen our planet's gemstones and we need to compete with them to get them back.

You will be given a random number, shown below at the start of each game."The Number You Are Chasing"

When you click on any of the gemstones below you will receive a random amount of points.

Try to match the random number given at the beginning of the game without going over your score [shown below].

If you go over the amount - you would have lost to the robots and the human race will be DOOMED.
If you match the amount and win the game, the human race will be spared.

Good Luck - And Donâ€™t Let Us Down.
!!!!!The game will restart at the end whether you Win or Lose [so keep fighting]!!!!


BEHIND THE SCENES:
The page is reset every time it is loaded.

A random number is displayed at the start of each game.

The user gains points by clicking on each gemstone [each one has a random value, which will not be shown, but their value will be added to the total score atthe bottom of the screen].

The user has to match the random "chase number" that the computer provided earlier to win. If they go over the amount then they lose/we are doomed.

If the user wins then an Alert will be given "Humanity Won"
If the user loses then an Alert will be given "We are Doomed"
